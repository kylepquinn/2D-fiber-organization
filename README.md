# 2D Fiber Organization

This repository contains MATLAB code for calculating pixel-wise fiber orientation maps ([Quinn et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1117/1.JBO.18.4.046003)), computing an overall circular mean and directional variance, and computing a local circular mean and directional variance.
